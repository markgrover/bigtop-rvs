<mahout>
  <metadata>
    <summary>A set of Java libraries for scalable machine learning.</summary>
    <description>Mahout's goal is to build scalable machine learning libraries.
 With scalable we mean:
 .
 Scalable to reasonably large data sets. Our core algorithms for clustering,
 classfication and batch based collaborative filtering are implemented on top of
 Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm. However we do not restrict
 contributions to Hadoop based implementations: Contributions that run on a
 single node or on a non-Hadoop cluster are welcome as well. The core libraries
 are highly optimized to allow for good performance also for non-distributed
 algorithms.
 Scalable to support your business case. Mahout is distributed under a
 commercially friendly Apache Software license.
 Scalable community. The goal of Mahout is to build a vibrant, responsive,
 diverse community to facilitate discussions not only on the project itself but
 also on potential use cases. Come to the mailing lists to find out more.</description>

<oozie>
  <metadata>
    <summary>Oozie is a system that runs workflows of Hadoop jobs.</summary>
    <description> Oozie is a system that runs workflows of Hadoop jobs.
 Oozie workflows are actions arranged in a control dependency DAG (Direct
 Acyclic Graph).

 Oozie coordinator functionality allows to start workflows at regular
 frequencies and when data becomes available in HDFS.

 An Oozie workflow may contain the following types of actions nodes:
 map-reduce, map-reduce streaming, map-reduce pipes, pig, file-system,
 sub-workflows, java, hive, sqoop and ssh (deprecated).

 Flow control operations within the workflow can be done using decision,
 fork and join nodes. Cycles in workflows are not supported.

 Actions and decisions can be parameterized with job properties, actions
 output (i.e. Hadoop counters) and HDFS  file information (file exists,
 file size, etc). Formal parameters are expressed in the workflow definition
 as ${VAR} variables.

 A Workflow application is an HDFS directory that contains the workflow
 definition (an XML file), all the necessary files to run all the actions:
 JAR files for Map/Reduce jobs, shells for streaming Map/Reduce jobs, native
 libraries, Pig scripts, and other resource files.

 Running workflow jobs is done via command line tools, a WebServices API
 or a Java API.

 Monitoring the system and workflow jobs can be done via a web console, the
 command line tools, the WebServices API and the Java API.

 Oozie is a transactional system and it has built in automatic and manual
 retry capabilities.

 In case of workflow job failure, the workflow job can be rerun skipping
 previously completed actions, the workflow application can be patched before
 being rerun.</description>

<zookeeper>
  <metadata>
    <summary>A high-performance coordination service for distributed applications.</summary>
    <description>ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.  All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them ,which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed.

<pig>
  <metadata>
    <summary>Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets</summary>
    <description>Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level language
 for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these
 programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable
 to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them to handle very large data sets.
 .
 At the present time, Pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces
 sequences of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel implementations already
 exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's language layer currently consists of a textual
 language called Pig Latin, which has the following key properties:
 .
 * Ease of programming
    It is trivial to achieve parallel execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data
    analysis tasks. Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data transformations
    are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences, making them easy to write, understand,
    and maintain.
 * Optimization opportunities
    The way in which tasks are encoded permits the system to optimize their execution
    automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than efficiency.
 * Extensibility
    Users can create their own functions to do special-purpose processing.</description>

    <description>Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop that
 provides tools to enable easy data summarization, adhoc querying and
 analysis of large datasets data stored in Hadoop files. It provides a
 mechanism to put structure on this data and it also provides a simple
 query language called Hive QL which is based on SQL and which enables
 users familiar with SQL to query this data. At the same time, this
 language also allows traditional map/reduce programmers to be able to
 plug in their custom mappers and reducers to do more sophisticated
 analysis which may not be supported by the built-in capabilities of
 the language.</description>

<hadoop>
  <metadata>
    <summary>Hadoop is a software platform for processing vast amounts of data</summary>
    <description>Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and
run applications that process vast amounts of data.

Here's what makes Hadoop especially useful:
* Scalable: Hadoop can reliably store and process petabytes.
* Economical: It distributes the data and processing across clusters
              of commonly available computers. These clusters can number
              into the thousands of nodes.
* Efficient: By distributing the data, Hadoop can process it in parallel
             on the nodes where the data is located. This makes it
             extremely rapid.
* Reliable: Hadoop automatically maintains multiple copies of data and
            automatically redeploys computing tasks based on failures.

Hadoop implements MapReduce, using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
MapReduce divides applications into many small blocks of work. HDFS creates
multiple replicas of data blocks for reliability, placing them on compute
nodes around the cluster. MapReduce can then process the data where it is
located.</description>

  <metadata>
    <summary>The Hadoop NextGen MapReduce (YARN)</summary>
    <description>YARN (Hadoop NextGen MapReduce) is a general purpose data-computation framework.
The fundamental idea of YARN is to split up the two major functionalities of the
JobTracker, resource management and job scheduling/monitoring, into separate daemons:
ResourceManager and NodeManager.

The ResourceManager is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all
the applications in the system. The NodeManager is a per-node slave managing allocation
of computational resources on a single node. Both work in support of per-application
ApplicationMaster (AM).

An ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework specific library and is tasked with
negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to
execute and monitor the tasks.</description>
